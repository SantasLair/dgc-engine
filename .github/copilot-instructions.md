# Copilot Instructions

<!-- Use this file to provide workspace-specific custom instructions to Copilot. For more details, visit https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/copilot/copilot-customization#_use-a-githubcopilotinstructionsmd-file -->

This is a turn-based movement game demo project built with:
- **Vite** - Fast build tool and development server
- **TypeScript** - Type-safe JavaScript development
- **EasyStar.js** - A* pathfinding library for 2D grids
- **HTML5 Canvas** - 2D rendering

## Game Architecture Guidelines

- Use object-oriented programming with TypeScript classes
- Implement a grid-based game board system
- Use EasyStar.js for pathfinding calculations
- Follow turn-based game patterns with clear state management
- Keep rendering logic separate from game logic
- Use proper TypeScript typing throughout the codebase

## Code Style

- Use descriptive variable and function names
- Implement proper error handling
- Add JSDoc comments for public methods
- Follow consistent naming conventions (camelCase for variables/functions, PascalCase for classes)
- Prefer composition over inheritance where appropriate
