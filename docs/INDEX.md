# DGC Engine Documentation

Welcome to the DGC Engine help documentation! The DGC Engine is a GameMaker-inspired game development framework that lets you build games using familiar GameMaker concepts and syntax.

DGC Engine is in very early development, it isn't usable yet.
These documentation files were generated by AI and reviewed as frequently as I have time.  They may contain errors or claims of "pefection" (AI loves to think its perfect).

## ðŸŽ® What is DGC Engine?

DGC Engine is designed to feel familiar to GameMaker Studio developers while providing modern web-based game development capabilities. You can:

- **Use GameMaker syntax** - Familiar functions like `room_goto()`, `obj_player.x`, and draw events
- **Build for the web** - Games run directly in web browsers
- **Rapid development** - Immediate mode rendering and hot reloading during development

## ðŸš€ Quick Examples

### Switch to a different room
```typescript
await room_goto('game')
```

### Access an object's position
```typescript
const playerX = GameObject.getInstanceProperty('Player', 'x')
```

### Draw custom graphics
```typescript
// In a draw event
const draw = game.getEngine().getDrawingSystem()
draw.drawCircle(x, y, 50, true, 0xFF0000)  // Red filled circle
```
