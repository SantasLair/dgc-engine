# Options Button Implementation

The MenuRoom now supports two different styles for the Options button to handle the "coming soon" state gracefully.

## Available Styles

### 1. Interactive Popup (`'popup'`)
- **Appearance**: Blue button with hover effects
- **Behavior**: Opens a detailed options popup with placeholder settings
- **Features**: 
  - Comprehensive options sections (Audio, Graphics, Controls)
  - Disabled controls with "Coming Soon" notice
  - Professional-looking modal dialog
  - Click outside to close functionality

### 2. Grayed Out (`'grayed'`)
- **Appearance**: Gray/disabled styling with reduced opacity
- **Behavior**: Button is disabled and shows tooltip on hover
- **Features**:
  - Clearly indicates unavailability
  - Tooltip explains "Options are not available yet"
  - Non-interactive (cursor: not-allowed)

## Configuration

To switch between styles, modify the `optionsStyle` property in `MenuRoom.ts`:

```typescript
// For interactive popup
private optionsStyle: 'popup' | 'grayed' = 'popup'

// For grayed-out button
private optionsStyle: 'popup' | 'grayed' = 'grayed'
```

## Popup Features

When using the `'popup'` style, the options dialog includes:

### Audio Settings
- Master Volume (0-100%)
- Sound Effects Volume (0-100%)
- Music Volume (0-100%)

### Graphics Settings
- Resolution dropdown (1920x1080, 1366x768, 1280x720)
- Fullscreen toggle
- VSync toggle

### Control Settings
- Mouse Sensitivity (0-100%)
- Invert Y-Axis toggle

All settings are currently disabled with a "Coming Soon" notice, but the UI framework is ready for future implementation.

## Implementation Notes

- The popup uses high z-index (3000) to appear above all other content
- All styles use `!important` to prevent CSS conflicts
- The popup is fully accessible with keyboard navigation
- Mobile-responsive design with percentage-based widths
- Clean, modern styling that matches the game's aesthetic

## Future Development

When implementing actual options functionality:

1. Remove the `disabled: true` flags from option controls
2. Add event handlers for each control
3. Connect to game settings system
4. Remove the "Coming Soon" notice
5. Add save/cancel functionality

The current implementation provides a solid foundation for future options development while providing a professional user experience in the interim.
