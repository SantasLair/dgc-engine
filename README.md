A work-in-progress GameMaker-style game engine built with **TypeScript**, **Pixi.js**, and modern web technologies. This project aims to become a professional game engine with room management, event-driven GameObjects, and industry-standard architecture.

## 🤖 AI-Assisted Development Showcase

This project serves as a **showcase for professional software development using AI code generation tools** (GitHub Copilot). It demonstrates:

- **Professional Architecture**: How AI can assist in building complex, well-structured game engines
- **Best Practices**: Modern TypeScript patterns, documentation, and project organization
- **Rapid Prototyping**: Accelerated development from concept to working engine architecture
- **Code Quality**: AI-assisted development while maintaining high standards and readability

> **⚠️ Work in Progress**: This engine is actively being developed and is far from complete. It currently demonstrates core concepts and architecture but lacks many features expected in a production game engine.

> **🎮 Prototype Game Implementation**: The current turn-based movement game is a **prototype/beta implementation** used to test and demonstrate the engine architecture. The game mechanics will be significantly improved and expanded as the engine develops.

## 🎮 Current Features

### Implemented ✅
- **Basic GameObject System**: Event-driven objects with CREATE, STEP, DRAW, DESTROY events
- **Room Management**: Basic level/scene organization and transitions
- **Event System**: Foundation for event handling and script system
- **Renderer Abstraction**: Pluggable rendering backends (currently Pixi.js)
- **Grid-based Movement**: Turn-based movement mechanics with pathfinding

### Game Features (Prototype/Beta)
- **Turn-based movement system** with click-to-move mechanics
- **A* pathfinding** using EasyStar.js library
- **Animated movement** along calculated paths
- **Obstacle avoidance** with randomly generated obstacles
- **Room-based organization** for levels and scenes

> **Note**: Game mechanics are currently in prototype/beta stage and serve as a testing ground for engine features. Significant improvements planned.

### Technology Stack
- **TypeScript** for type safety and modern development
- **Pixi.js** for WebGL-accelerated 2D rendering
- **Vite** for fast development and hot reload
- **EasyStar.js** for pathfinding algorithms

## 🚧 Planned Features

### Engine Goals 🎯
- **Complete GameObject System**: Full GameMaker-style object lifecycle
- **Advanced Room System**: Transitions, persistence, and complex room interactions
- **Asset Management**: Sprite, sound, and resource loading systems
- **Physics Integration**: 2D physics engine integration
- **Audio System**: Sound effects and music management
- **Save/Load System**: Game state persistence
- **Scripting System**: Visual or text-based scripting for game logic
- **Performance Optimization**: Object pooling, efficient rendering
- **Debug Tools**: Inspector, profiler, and debugging utilities

### Additional Features 🔮
- **Multiple Renderer Support**: Canvas 2D, WebGL, potentially WebGPU
- **Mobile Support**: Touch controls and responsive design
- **Multiplayer Foundation**: Network architecture for multiplayer games
- **Asset Pipeline**: Build tools for asset optimization
- **Editor Interface**: Visual editor for rooms and objects
- **Plugin System**: Extensible architecture for custom functionality

## 🎮 Current Demo Mechanics

### Turn-Based Movement (Prototype Implementation)
1. **First click** on any walkable cell shows the calculated path to that position
2. **Second click** on the same target cell executes the movement
3. The game calculates the shortest path using A* algorithm
4. The player moves step-by-step along the calculated path
5. Each movement sequence counts as one turn
6. Obstacles block movement and pathfinding

### Basic Room System
- **Game Room**: Main gameplay area with player and obstacles
- **Menu Room**: Basic navigation (work in progress)
- **Room Transitions**: Basic switching between game areas

> **Note**: The current demo showcases the foundational architecture but many GameMaker features are still in development. The game implementation is a **prototype/beta** used to test engine capabilities and will be significantly enhanced as the engine matures.

- Click on a different cell to show a new path instead
- Wait for the current movement to complete before making new moves

## Customization

You can easily customize the game by modifying:

- **Grid size**: Change `GameBoard` constructor parameters in `Game.ts`

## Architecture

The game follows a modular architecture:

1. **Game**: Main controller that coordinates all components
2. **GameBoard**: Manages the grid state and obstacle placement
3. **Player**: Handles player position and movement
4. **Renderer**: Handles all canvas drawing operations
5. **Types**: Shared TypeScript interfaces and types
