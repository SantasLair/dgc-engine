# Session 9: Dev-Log Refactoring (August 6, 2025)

> Restructuring development documentation for improved maintainability and navigation

## Documentation Architecture Overhaul - `TBD` ðŸ“š
**Goal**: Transform monolithic dev-log into modular, maintainable documentation system

**What was restructured:**
- Split single `DEV_LOG.md` into main summary + individual session documents
- Created dedicated `sessions/` subfolder for detailed documentation
- Implemented zero-padded numbering system (00001-00008)
- Established consistent session documentation structure

**Key Files Created:**
- `history/sessions/00001-foundation.md` - Foundation session details
- `history/sessions/00002-rendering.md` - Rendering upgrade documentation
- `history/sessions/00003-engine-architecture.md` - Engine framework development
- `history/sessions/00004-cleanup.md` - Codebase organization session
- `history/sessions/00005-abstraction.md` - Advanced architectural patterns
- `history/sessions/00006-room-system.md` - Professional game organization
- `history/sessions/00007-gamemaker-organization.md` - Perfect folder structure
- `history/sessions/00008-gml-compatibility.md` - Dual paradigm support
- `history/sessions/README.md` - Session navigation and overview

**Architecture**: Modular documentation with centralized navigation and cross-references

---

## Terminology Evolution - `TBD` ðŸ”„
**Enhancement**: Refined naming conventions based on user feedback

**Changes:**
- Renamed "phases" to "sessions" throughout all documentation
- Updated all internal headers and references
- Maintained chronological numbering and structure
- Improved semantic clarity and consistency

**Impact**: Better terminology alignment with development workflow concepts

---

## File Naming Optimization - `TBD` âœ¨
**Enhancement**: Cleaner, more maintainable file naming

**Changes:**
- Removed "session" prefix from individual session filenames
- Maintained zero-padded numbering for proper sorting (00001-00008)
- Updated all internal links and cross-references
- Simplified navigation while preserving organization

**Before**: `session00001-foundation.md`
**After**: `00001-foundation.md`

**Impact**: Cleaner file structure with improved readability and reduced redundancy

## Session Summary

**Key Achievement**: Transformed development documentation from monolithic to modular architecture with improved maintainability and navigation.

**Technical Foundation**:
- Modular documentation structure
- Zero-padded numbering system for proper sorting
- Consistent cross-referencing and navigation
- Clean, descriptive naming conventions

**Architecture Pattern**: Hub-and-spoke documentation model with main summary linking to detailed session documents, enabling easy navigation and maintenance while preserving historical context.

**Documentation Metrics**:
- **Sessions Documented**: 8 historical + 1 meta (refactoring)
- **Files Organized**: 9 session documents + navigation README
- **Links Updated**: 16+ internal references corrected
- **Structure Depth**: 2-level hierarchy (main â†’ sessions)

**Future Benefits**:
- Easy addition of new sessions without modifying existing structure
- Clear separation of concerns between overview and details
- Improved searchability and navigation
- Reduced cognitive load when reviewing specific development periods
