# Session 3: Engine Architecture (January 5, 2025)

> The paradigm shift from simple game to comprehensive game engine

## GameMaker-Style Engine - `6cb0a5e` üèóÔ∏è
**Paradigm Shift**: From simple game to game engine

**Revolutionary Changes:**
- **GameObject System**: Event-driven object architecture
- **Event Manager**: GameMaker-style event handling (CREATE, STEP, DRAW, DESTROY)
- **Game Engine Core**: Centralized engine management
- **Object Manager**: Automatic lifecycle management

**New Engine Components:**
- `src/engine/GameEngine.ts` (380 lines) - Core engine
- `src/engine/GameObject.ts` (299 lines) - Base object class
- `src/engine/EventManager.ts` (98 lines) - Event system
- `src/engine/GameObjectManager.ts` (250 lines) - Object lifecycle
- `ENGINE.md` (305 lines) - Comprehensive documentation

**Architecture Philosophy:**
```
GameMaker Pattern:
Object ‚Üí Events ‚Üí Engine ‚Üí Renderer
```

**Impact**: Transformed from game to reusable engine framework

## Enhanced GameObject System - `957d997` üéÆ
**Content Expansion**: Rich game objects with AI

**New GameObjects:**
- **Player** (173 lines): Enhanced with health, inventory, collision
- **Enemy** (165 lines): AI behavior, pathfinding, combat
- **Item** (194 lines): Collectibles, effects, consumables

**Features Added:**
- AI pathfinding algorithms
- Combat mechanics
- Inventory systems
- Health management
- Score tracking

**Result**: Full-featured game entities with complex behaviors

## Session Summary

**Key Achievement**: Fundamental transformation from a simple game to a reusable game engine framework.

**Architectural Revolution**:
- Event-driven GameObject system
- GameMaker-style event handling
- Centralized engine management
- Automatic object lifecycle management

**Technical Milestone**: Established the core engine architecture that would support all future features and complexity.
