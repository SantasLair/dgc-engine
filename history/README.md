## 🎯 Key Milestones

### 🚀 **Major Architectural Shifts**
1. **Simple Game → Game Engine** (`6cb0a5e`) - Event-driven GameObject system
2. **Canvas 2D → Pixi.js** (`18dd7da`) - Professional rendering
3. **Monolithic → Room-Based** (`5909ee8`) - Level management system
4. **Scattered → GameMaker Structure** (`50e974a`, `ad893a2`) - Industry conventions

### 📈 **Technical Evolution**
- **Lines of Code**: 600 → 2,000+ (excluding docs)
- **Architecture**: Procedural → Event-Driven → Room-Based
- **Documentation**: 1,000+ lines of comprehensive guides
- **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript coverage

### 🏆 **Final Achievements**
- ✅ GameMaker Studio folder structure
- ✅ Event-driven GameObject framework
- ✅ Professional room management
- ✅ Pluggable renderer architecture
- ✅ Type-safe development
- ✅ Hot reload development environment
