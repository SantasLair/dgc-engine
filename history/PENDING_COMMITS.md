# Pending Commits for Next Session

> Track minor commits and improvements between major development sessions for easier grouping and documentation.

## Current Tracking Period
**Started**: August 6, 2025 (after Session 11)  
**Last Session**: [Session 11: Copilot Configuration](./sessions/00011-copilot-configuration.md)

## Pending Commits

### Format: `commit_hash` - Brief description (Date)
*Use this format to track commits until they're grouped into a session*

---

## Usage Instructions

1. **Add commits as they happen**: Record each minor commit with hash and brief description
2. **Group when ready**: When enough commits accumulate or a major feature is complete, create a new session document
3. **Clear after grouping**: Move commits to the new session document and clear this file
4. **Categorize commits**: Group related commits by theme (e.g., "Bug fixes", "Documentation", "Minor features")

## Commit Categories

Use these categories to help organize commits:

- **🐛 Bug Fixes**: Error corrections and issue resolutions
- **📚 Documentation**: README updates, code comments, guides
- **✨ Minor Features**: Small feature additions or enhancements
- **🧹 Cleanup**: Code organization, formatting, refactoring
- **🔧 Configuration**: Settings, build tools, environment setup
- **🎨 UI/UX**: Interface improvements, styling changes
- **⚡ Performance**: Optimization and performance improvements
- **🔒 Security**: Security-related changes and fixes
