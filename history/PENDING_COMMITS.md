## Usage Instructions

1. **Add commits as they happen**: Record each minor commit with hash and brief description
2. **Group when ready**: When enough commits accumulate or a major feature is complete, create a new milestone document
3. **Clear after grouping**: Move commits to the new milestone document and clear this file
4. **Categorize commits**: Group related commits by theme (e.g., "Bug fixes", "Documentation", "Minor features")

- **🐛 Bug Fixes**: Error corrections and issue resolutions
