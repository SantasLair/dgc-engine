### Format: `commit_hash` - Brief description (Date)
*Use this format to track commits until they're grouped into a milestone*

### üé® Rapid.js Integration (Major Feature - COMPLETE PIXI REPLACEMENT)

- `TBD` - Created DGCRapidEngine to replace DGCEngine with Rapid.js backend (August 7, 2025)
- `TBD` - Created DGCRapidGame base class for Rapid.js-powered games (August 7, 2025)
- `TBD` - Updated Game.ts to use DGCRapidGame and Rapid.js configuration (August 7, 2025)
- `TBD` - Completely rewrote SpriteTestRoom to demonstrate Rapid.js rendering (August 7, 2025)
- `TBD` - Updated engine index.ts to export new Rapid.js classes (August 7, 2025)

### üé® GameMaker Draw Events Implementation (Previous Major Feature)
- `TBD` - Implemented DGCDrawingSystem with authentic GameMaker drawing functions (August 7, 2025)
- `TBD` - Added automatic frame clearing system for proper draw event behavior (August 7, 2025) 
- `TBD` - Corrected SpriteTestRoom with true GameMaker-style immediate rendering commands (August 7, 2025)
- `TBD` - Integrated drawing system into DGCEngine and room system (August 7, 2025)
- `TBD` - Added Sprite and SpriteManager classes for sprite resource management (August 7, 2025)

### üìö Documentation  
- `9c6e17b` - Created Milestone 12: Basic Movement System Fix documentation (August 6, 2025)
- `TBD` - Created comprehensive GameMaker draw events documentation (August 7, 2025)
- `TBD` - Created PIXI ticker vs custom game loop analysis documentation (August 7, 2025)

### ‚ú® Minor Features
- `e3b605f` - Added Phaser-style full-screen game mode to GameRoom (August 6, 2025)
- `TBD` - Added getEngine() method to Game class for drawing system access (August 7, 2025)

### Notes
**Branch Context**: Currently on `feature/rapid-js-exploration` branch to explore Rapid.js as an alternative immediate mode rendering solution.

**Major Implementation**: Completed TRUE GameMaker-style draw events with immediate rendering commands instead of sprite property modifications. This includes:
- DGCDrawingSystem providing drawSprite(), drawLine(), drawRectangle(), drawCircle(), drawText(), drawArrow(), drawHealthbar()
- Automatic frame clearing between draw cycles (authentic GameMaker behavior)
- Complete rewrite of draw event demos to use immediate commands
- Full PIXI container management and cleanup system

**Rapid.js Replacement COMPLETED**: Successfully replaced PIXI.js completely with Rapid.js as the rendering backend. This provides native immediate mode rendering semantics that align perfectly with GameMaker's draw event model. Key achievements:

- Complete removal of PIXI.js dependency
- New DGCRapidDrawingSystem providing GameMaker-style immediate drawing API
- DGCRapidEngine and DGCRapidGame classes for Rapid.js-powered games
- SpriteTestRoom rewritten to demonstrate Rapid.js rendering capabilities
- Maintains same GameMaker-style API while using superior immediate mode renderer

**Previous commits grouped**: Movement system fix commits from Session 12 have been documented in [Milestone 12](./milestones/00012-movement-fix.md).

## Usage Instructions

1. **Add commits as they happen**: Record each minor commit with hash and brief description
2. **Group when ready**: When enough commits accumulate or a major feature is complete, create a new milestone document
3. **Clear after grouping**: Move commits to the new milestone document and clear this file
4. **Categorize commits**: Group related commits by theme (e.g., "Bug fixes", "Documentation", "Minor features")

## Commit Categories

Use these categories to help organize commits:

- **üêõ Bug Fixes**: Error corrections and issue resolutions
- **üìö Documentation**: README updates, code comments, guides
- **‚ú® Minor Features**: Small feature additions or enhancements
- **üßπ Cleanup**: Code organization, formatting, refactoring
- **üîß Configuration**: Settings, build tools, environment setup
- **üé® UI/UX**: Interface improvements, styling changes
- **‚ö° Performance**: Optimization and performance improvements
- **üîí Security**: Security-related changes and fixes
