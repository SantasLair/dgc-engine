## GameObject Organization - `ad893a2` 📁
**Final Organization**: GameMaker-style folder structure

**Complete Organization:**
- Created `src/game/gameobjects/` folder
- Moved all GameObjects to dedicated folder:

  - `GameBoard.ts` - Grid-based board
- `gameobjects/README.md` - GameMaker conventions guide
- Updated all imports across the project

**Final Architecture:**
```
src/game/
├── gameobjects/          # GameMaker-style GameObjects
├── rooms/                # GameMaker-style Rooms  
├── Game.ts               # Main game class
└── types.ts              # Type definitions
```

**Result**: Perfect GameMaker Studio folder structure and conventions
