# Design Decision: Binary Data Format Migration

**Decision Date**: August 8, 2025  
**Status**: Approved  
**Deciders**: DGC Engine Team  

## Context

The DGC Engine currently uses JSON files for room data configuration. While JSON is human-readable and easy to edit during development, it has several limitations for production game deployment:

1. **Performance**: JSON parsing is slower than binary formats
2. **File Size**: JSON is verbose with unnecessary whitespace and repetitive keys
3. **Security**: Plain text files are easily modified by end users
4. **Professional Feel**: Shipping loose JSON files doesn't feel like a "compiled" game

## Decision

We will implement **MessagePack** as the primary binary data format for production builds, while maintaining JSON for development workflow.

## Rationale

### Why MessagePack?

1. **Minimal Migration Risk**
   - Drop-in replacement for JSON.parse/stringify
   - No schema definitions required
   - Existing JSON structure works unchanged

2. **Immediate Performance Benefits**
   - 30-50% smaller file sizes
   - 2-3x faster parsing than JSON
   - Binary format provides natural obfuscation

3. **Development Workflow Compatibility**
   - Continue editing JSON during development
   - Build process automatically converts to MessagePack
   - Easy debugging (can convert back to JSON)

4. **GameMaker-Style Feel**
   - Binary data files feel more "compiled"
   - Professional game distribution format
   - Harder for casual user modification

### Alternative Options Considered

| Option | Pros | Cons | Decision |
|--------|------|------|----------|
| **Protocol Buffers** | Very compact, schema validation | Requires schema definitions, complex setup | ‚ùå Too complex |
| **Custom Binary** | Maximum control | High maintenance, development overhead | ‚ùå Not worth effort |
| **SQLite WASM** | Queryable data, excellent compression | Overkill for simple room data | ‚ùå Too complex |
| **ZIP Archives** | Asset bundling, compression | More complex, harder to debug | üîÑ Future consideration |
| **Webpack Bundling** | Build-time optimization | Loses data-driven flexibility | ‚ùå Against design goals |

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: MessagePack Integration (Current)

1. **Add MessagePack Dependency**
   ```bash
   npm install @msgpack/msgpack
   ```

2. **Dual Format Support**
   - RoomFactory supports both JSON and MessagePack files
   - Development: continue using JSON files
   - Production: build process generates `.msgpack` files

3. **Build Process Enhancement**
   - Vite plugin converts JSON ‚Üí MessagePack during build
   - Source JSON files remain in `src/game/rooms/data/`
   - Generated `.msgpack` files in `public/data/rooms/`

4. **File Extension Strategy**
   - Development: `.json` files (human-editable)
   - Production: `.dgcroom` files (MessagePack binary)
   - Clear distinction between formats

### Phase 2: Asset Bundling (Future)

Consider upgrading to ZIP-based archive system:
- Bundle room data + sprites + audio into single `.dgc` files
- Game packages become self-contained
- Better for distribution and version management

## Technical Design

### File Format Detection

```typescript
// RoomFactory will detect format by file extension
public async createRoomFromFile(filename: string): Promise<Room> {
  if (filename.endsWith('.dgcroom')) {
    // Load MessagePack binary format
    return this.loadMessagePackRoom(filename)
  } else if (filename.endsWith('.json')) {
    // Load JSON format (development)
    return this.loadJsonRoom(filename)
  }
  throw new Error(`Unsupported file format: ${filename}`)
}
```

### Build Process

```typescript
// Vite plugin to convert JSON ‚Üí MessagePack
function convertRoomDataPlugin() {
  return {
    name: 'convert-room-data',
    buildStart() {
      // Convert all JSON room files to .dgcroom files
      convertJsonToMessagePack()
    }
  }
}
```

### Development Experience

- **Development**: Edit JSON files as usual
- **Testing**: Option to test with MessagePack builds
- **Production**: Ship only `.dgcroom` files
- **Debugging**: Utilities to convert back to JSON

## Benefits

### Immediate (Phase 1)
- ‚úÖ 30-50% smaller file sizes
- ‚úÖ 2-3x faster loading
- ‚úÖ Binary format obscures game data
- ‚úÖ Professional distribution format
- ‚úÖ Maintains development workflow

### Future (Phase 2)
- üîÑ Single-file game packages
- üîÑ Asset bundling capability
- üîÑ Version control for game builds
- üîÑ Advanced compression options

## Risks and Mitigations

| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|
| MessagePack parsing errors | High | Fallback to JSON, extensive testing |
| Binary debugging difficulty | Medium | Dev tools to convert back to JSON |
| Build process complexity | Low | Gradual rollout, maintain JSON support |
| Third-party dependency | Low | MessagePack is stable, widely used |

## Success Metrics

- File size reduction: Target 30%+ smaller
- Loading performance: Target 2x faster parsing
- Development workflow: No disruption to JSON editing
- Build time: Minimal impact (<10% increase)

## Decision Outcome

**Approved**: Implement MessagePack with dual-format support.

**Next Steps**:
1. Install MessagePack dependency
2. Extend RoomFactory for binary format support
3. Create build process for JSON ‚Üí MessagePack conversion
4. Add development tools for binary ‚Üî JSON conversion
5. Update documentation
