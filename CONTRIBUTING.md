# Contributing to DGC Engine (Dream Game Crafter)

Thank you for your interest in **DGC Engine** - the Dream Game Crafter! This flexible GameMaker-style game engine is designed with adaptability in mind while maintaining the familiar feel of a web-first GameMaker-style engine. This project serves as both a functional game engine and an educational resource demonstrating modern game development practices.

> **üöß Current Status**: This project is **not currently accepting public contributions** as it's in early development stages. Once the engine reaches a more mature state with stable architecture and comprehensive documentation, public contributions will be welcomed.

## üéØ Project Goals

This project aims to:
- Demonstrate GameMaker-style architecture in TypeScript
- Showcase professional AI-assisted development practices  
- Provide a learning resource for game engine development
- Show professional documentation and development practices
- Create a foundation for 2D game development
- Build a flexible engine that adapts to your development style

## üèóÔ∏è Development Information

*The following sections are for reference and future use when contributions are accepted.*

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 16+ 
- npm or yarn
- Git
- Code editor (VS Code recommended)

### Setup Steps
1. **Fork the repository** on GitHub (when contributions are open)
2. **Clone your fork**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/dgc-engine.git
   cd dgc-engine
   ```
3. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
4. **Start development server**:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
5. **Create a feature branch**:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```

## üìù Code Style Guidelines

### TypeScript Standards
- Use **strict TypeScript** settings
- Prefer **interfaces** over types for object shapes
- Use **descriptive variable names**
- Add **JSDoc comments** for public methods

### GameMaker Conventions
- **GameObjects** go in `src/game/gameobjects/`
- **Rooms** go in `src/game/rooms/`
- Use **GameMaker-style events** (CREATE, STEP, DRAW, DESTROY)
- Follow **PascalCase** for classes, **camelCase** for variables

### Example GameObject:
```typescript
export class NewGameObject extends GameObject {
  constructor(x: number, y: number) {
    super('NewGameObject', { x, y, visible: true })
    this.setupEvents()
  }

  private setupEvents(): void {
    this.addEventScript(GameEvent.CREATE, (self) => {
      // Initialization logic
    })

    this.addEventScript(GameEvent.STEP, (self) => {
      // Per-frame logic
    })
  }
}
```
